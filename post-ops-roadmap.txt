# ⚡ Trades Helper-On-Demand — Post-MVP Roadmap

## **Phase 2: Trust & Safety (Immediate Next Sprint)**

**Goal:** Build user trust and reduce risk so early adopters feel secure.
**Features:**

1. **Ratings & Reviews System**

   * JSON schema: `{ job_id, helper_id, tradie_id, rating (1-5), comment, created_at }`
   * Display reviews in profile view.
2. **Dispute Resolution Flow**

   * Add “Raise a Dispute” button after job completion.
   * Admin dashboard extension: dispute status (`open / in_review / resolved`).
3. **Basic T\&Cs + Liability Disclaimers**

   * Show and require acceptance at signup.
   * Store consent record in DB.

## **Phase 3: Payments & Compliance**

**Goal:** Ensure smooth payouts and compliance with AU regulations.
**Features:**

1. **Stripe Connect Payouts (AU Helpers)**

   * Helpers onboard as Stripe Express accounts.
   * Validate AU bank account linking & identity verification.
2. **Automated ID Verification (Optional KYC API)**

   * Integrate OCR / AU KYC APIs (e.g. FrankieOne, SumSub) to reduce manual workload.
3. **Escrow Enhancements**

   * Auto-refunds after X days if job unresolved.
   * Transaction fee transparency (platform cut visible to both sides).

## **Phase 4: Growth & Retention**

**Goal:** Build network effects and make helpers/tradies stick.
**Features:**

1. **Referral Program**

   * Tradie invites another tradie = both get credit.
   * Helper invites another helper = priority access to jobs.
2. **Helper Availability Calendar**

   * Helpers mark when they’re free.
   * Tradies can “book in advance” with confirmed helpers.
3. **Job Categories/Tags**

   * Add job\_type column (`cleanup, materials handling, painting prep`).
   * Improves discovery and targeted matching.
4. **Job Completion Badge System**

   * Helpers earn badges (“5 jobs done”, “Top Rated”).
   * Boosts trust & retention.

---

## **Phase 5: Ops & Scalability**

**Goal:** Strengthen backend, monitoring, and fraud prevention for growth.
**Features:**

1. **Admin Monitoring Dashboard 2.0**

   * Add analytics: jobs posted per week, avg pay rate, churn rates.
   * Fraud detection (e.g., repeat fake jobs).
2. **Notification Enhancements**

   * Expand from in-app → SMS + Email for critical events (job accepted, payment released).
3. **Support Ticket System**

   * Lightweight: allow users to submit issues linked to jobs/payments.
   * Admin can track resolution.
4. **Logging & Monitoring**

   * Error tracking (Sentry) + performance monitoring.
   * Real-time health dashboard (jobs, payments, chat uptime).

✅ **Implementation Order Recommendation**

1. **Phase 2 (Trust & Safety)** → Without this, scaling is risky.
2. **Phase 3 (Payments & Compliance)** → Ensures helpers can actually cash out.
3. **Phase 4 (Growth & Retention)** → Fuels acquisition loops once trust + payments are solid.
4. **Phase 5 (Ops & Scalability)** → Required before expanding beyond pilot regions.
