  🚨 Critical Gaps for Production

  1. Backend API Server - MISSING 🔴

  Impact: HIGH
  - Issue: Frontend calls /api/stripe/* endpoints that don't exist
  - Found: StripeService expects /api/stripe/create-connect-account and other endpoints
  - Solution Needed: Express.js/Node.js API server with:
    - Stripe webhook handlers
    - Payment processing endpoints
    - File upload handling
    - Email notification service

  2. Stripe Integration - INCOMPLETE 🟠

  Impact: HIGH
  - Current: Frontend UI exists, backend integration missing
  - Gaps:
    - No server-side Stripe webhook processing
    - No actual payment processing
    - No Connect onboarding completion
    - Mock payment buttons only

  3. File Upload System - NOT IMPLEMENTED 🔴

  Impact: MEDIUM-HIGH
  - Current: Placeholder fields for White Card, ID documents
  - Missing:
    - Supabase Storage integration
    - File validation and processing
    - Document verification workflow

  5. Mobile Responsiveness - LIMITED 🟡

  Impact: MEDIUM
  - Current: Basic Tailwind responsive classes
  - Missing:
    - Comprehensive mobile testing
    - Touch-friendly interface elements
    - Mobile-specific navigation patterns
